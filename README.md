# Movie-Recommender-Systems
● Content-based filtering: conducted feature engineering for unstructured text features using NLP models (bag-of-words and
word2vec) and implemented recommender systems using cosine similarity

● Collaborative filtering: explored and implemented item-based collaborative filtering, user-based collaborative filtering, and
matrix factorization (SVD) algorithms in building the movie recommender system

● Evaluated the performance of the movie recommender system using RMSE
